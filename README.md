## Shitstorm: a weather app with a bad attitude.

Shitstorm gives you the weather and a thorough dressing-down at the same time. You can use it at [https://shitstorm.app](https://shitstorm.app).

### Supported countries

Right now Shitstorm only works in the UK. The vision was to launch this first version with at least some international support, but timezone issues and API efficiency decisions have led to this being UK only, for now at least.

### Villages and small towns

Currently only towns are supported by the search function - you should be able to get your small village using geolocation though.

### Feedback and collaboration

Both are welcome. My email address is wilf@thisiswilf.com. My personal website is [https://thisiswilf.com](https://thisiswilf.com) if you want to have a look at that too. I'd love to hear ideas on expanding the supported countries, or about any other projects you're interested in working on.
